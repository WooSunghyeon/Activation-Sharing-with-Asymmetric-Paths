# Activation-Sharing-with-Asymmetric-Paths

This repository is the official implementation of Activation-Sharing-with-Asymmetirc-Paths. 

+ The proposed biologically plausible algorithm supports training deep convolutional networks without the weight transport problem and bidirectional connections
+ The proposed biologically plausible algorithm significantly cand reduce memory access overhead when implemented in hardware.
